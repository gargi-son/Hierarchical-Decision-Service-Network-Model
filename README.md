# Hierarchical-Decision-Service-Network-Model

Consider the posted folder cs787_ha3_and_exam_sn_template folder. 

Make sure that Pyomo package is installed:
https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

Under the subfolder solution, duplicate the Python module ams_extended_template.py into ams_extended.py

Implement the required analytic models (see below) by filling out ams_extended.py template. Example inputs and corresponding outputs are given in the folder example_input_output. 

To run the implemented functions in Problem 1 in the Problem Statement file, use solution/main_extended.py

  a. In terminal, make the downloaded folder your current folder
  
  b. Run main_extended.py in Python w/ stdin being the model input stdout being the model output.

Example:

python solution/main_extended.py < example_input_output/sn_extended_in.json > answers/out.json
to get answers in out.json which you can compare with the correct answer, 

e.g., in example_input_output/sn_extended_out.json
